# BC2Rome Docker Image for Project Rome 
## Description
Do you remember the electrifying moments when you first stepped onto the virtual battlefields of Battlefield Bad Company 2, and nostalgia washed over you like a wave? If you've ever yearned to recapture those unforgettable memories by playing it again, you're not alone. My mission is inspired by the allure of nostalgia and the desire to make it effortless for all Battlefield lovers to host a Server.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

    Linux Server: You should have access to a Linux server where you intend to host your Battlefield server. This guide assumes you have basic Linux command-line knowledge.

    Docker Engine: Docker should be installed and running on your Linux server. If you haven't installed Docker, you can follow the official Docker installation guide for your Linux distribution.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your Battlefield server on Linux using Docker:
Step 1: Prepare Your Server

Ensure your server is up to date by running:

bash

sudo apt update

Use the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution (e.g., yum for CentOS, dnf for Fedora).
Step 2: Pull the Battlefield Server Image

Pull the official Battlefield server Docker image from the Docker Hub:

bash

docker pull eaofficial/battlefield-server:[VERSION]

Replace [VERSION] with the desired version number (e.g., latest for the latest version).
Step 3: Create a Battlefield Server Container

Use the docker run command to create a new container from the Battlefield server image. Customize the server settings using environment variables and provide the necessary ports for your server:

bash

docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \         # Example ports, adjust as needed
  -p 443:443 \
  -e BATTLEFIELD_SERVER_NAME="My Battlefield Server" \
  -e BATTLEFIELD_ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourAdminPassword" \
  -e BATTLEFIELD_SERVER_PASSWORD="YourServerPassword" \
  eaofficial/battlefield-server:[VERSION]

Remember to replace [VERSION] with the appropriate version tag and customize the server name and passwords as needed.
Step 4: Access Your Battlefield Server

To interact with your Battlefield server, attach to the running container using the following command:

bash

docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash

Replace CONTAINER_ID with the actual container ID obtained when you created the container.

Inside the container, you can start or stop the Battlefield server using the following commands:

bash

./start.sh
./stop.sh

Step 5: Access the Web Admin Interface (Optional)

If your Battlefield server supports it, you can access the web admin interface by opening a web browser and navigating to:

bash

https://your-server-ip:443/admin

Log in using the admin password you specified during container creation.
Step 6: Troubleshooting and Maintenance

For troubleshooting and maintenance, refer to the official Battlefield server documentation and Docker documentation.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Battlefield server on Linux using Docker. Customize your server, invite friends, and start reliving the epic Battlefield experience.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to our FAQ or reach out to our community for support.

Enjoy your Battlefield adventures!

Note: This is a simplified guide for setting up a Battlefield server using Docker. For advanced configurations and specific game mode settings, consult the official documentation for the Battlefield server software.
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
