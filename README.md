# BC2Rome Docker Image for Project Rome 

Do you remember the electrifying moments when you first stepped onto the virtual battlefields of Battlefield Bad Company 2, and nostalgia washed over you like a wave? If you've ever yearned to recapture those unforgettable memories by playing it again, you're not alone. My mission is inspired by the allure of nostalgia and the desire to make it effortless for all Battlefield lovers to host a Server.
