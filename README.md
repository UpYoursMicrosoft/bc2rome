## Accessing-Server (Client)
It's essential to ensure that you have the latest game update installed and [ProjectRome](https://veniceunleashed.net/downloads)
After downloading Project Rome, follow these steps:

   - Unzip the downloaded file to extract its contents
   - Locate the file named dinput8.dll from the extracted files
   - Place the dinput8.dll file into your game directory

## Game-Server-Configuration
You can configure a lot on R34, for comprehensive documentation, you can download DOCS [here](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk) (not uploaded by me).
However, here's a quick overview of the basic configuration steps:

Open ServerOptions.ini 
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
- Change your Admin Password (RemoteAdminPassword=Password)

- Change Server Name (Name=ServerName) This refers to the name of your game server, which will be displayed in the server browser.

Open Startup.txt
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
- Change/Remove Banner (Remove all or replace Url (512x64 smaller than 127kb, .PNG format))

#Banner 
vars.bannerUrl https://i.ibb.co/ZXd7QzS/banner.png



Open maplist.txt  
```
nano ./Instance/mapslist.txt
```
- First line is gamemode for example RUSH CONQUEST etc.
Example:

RUSH

Levels/MP_002 0

Levels/MP_004 0

Levels/MP_005GR 0
Levels/MP_006 0
Levels/MP_007GR 0
Levels/MP_008 0
Levels/MP_009GR 0
Levels/MP_012GR 0
Levels/BC1_Oasis_GR 0
Levels/BC1_Harvest_Day_GR 0
Levels/MP_SP_002GR 0
Remember maps are gamemode dependent!

See all Map names in [DOCS](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk), 
Map always starts with Levels/!
## Easy-Administration-Procon
For easy administration download Procon from [here](https://myrcon.net/files/).
Create Connection, enter public IP from your server and enter password which we set in ServerOptions.ini in /Instance Folder (RemoteAdminPassword) and connect.
## Future-Features
- Integrate Procon Layer for permanent plugins & easy administration
