After downloading Project Rome, follow these steps:

   - Unzip the downloaded file to extract its contents
   - Locate the file named dinput8.dll from the extracted files
   - Place the dinput8.dll file into your game directory

## Game-Server-Configuration
You can configure a lot on R34, for comprehensive documentation, you can download DOCS [here](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk) (not uploaded by me).
However, here's a quick overview of the basic configuration steps:
- Important! Change Admin Password
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
RemoteAdminPassword=<Password>
- To Change Server Name open ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini with a text editor:
```
nano ./Instance/ServerOptions.ini
```
Name= <This refers to the name of your game server, which will be displayed in the server browser.>
- Change/Remove Banner
```
./Instance/AdminScripts/Startup.txt
```
Remove all or replace Url (512x64 smaller than 127kb, .PNG format): 
#Banner 
vars.bannerUrl https://i.ibb.co/ZXd7QzS/banner.png

- Change Map rotation
  
```
nano ./Instance/mapslist.txt
``` 
See all Map names in [DOCS](https://mega.nz/file/zjhkTbqZ#5kbq4FnHke9-C7IzU4m28fJ0MzbCfZ30cJiPxFXagWk), 
Map always starts with Levels/!
## Easy-Administration-Procon
For easy administration download Procon from [here](https://myrcon.net/files/).
Create Connection, enter public IP from your server and enter password which we set in ServerOptions.ini in /Instance Folder (RemoteAdminPassword) and connect.
